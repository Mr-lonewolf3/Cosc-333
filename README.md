# C++ Factorial & Fibonacci Programs with Runtime Calcultion

This repository contains **C++ programs** for:
- **Factorial calculation** (`factorial.cpp`) - Computes the factorial of a number and measures execution time.
- **Fibonacci sequence** (`fibonacci.cpp`) - Computes the Fibonacci sequence using both **recursion** and **iteration**, with runtime measurement.

Each program **calculates the required values** and also **measures execution time**, making it useful for performance analysis.
